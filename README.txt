This is my take on the classic game of word search. As part of sharpening my programming skills, I used the Pygame module to create a word search game. I would highly appreciate if you all could go through it and make suggestions to improve it. I am well aware there is a lot of room for imporvement and I look forward to hearing from much more experienced programmers than me. Also please share this if you like it and feel free to use this and add on it. 

Working
-The Game consists of a 15x15 grid and 10 words to solve.
-The generate.py file has been made to create a grid and insert words into it
-The Board.py file has been set up in order to create and designs the board in pygame and to set up the game
-You drag and release over the words in order to select them and if the selected word is correct then the selection turns from green to cyan
-Once all the words have been selected you Win! Congratulations

Requirements:
-Any Version of Pygame(most preferably the latest one)
